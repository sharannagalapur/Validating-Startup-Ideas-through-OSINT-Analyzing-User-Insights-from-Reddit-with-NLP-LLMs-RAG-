# Validating-Startup-Ideas-through-OSINT-Analyzing-User-Insights-from-Reddit-with-NLP-LLMs-RAG-
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that leverages real-world Reddit data from startup and entrepreneurship communities to answer user queries with relevant insights. By combining vector search on user-generated content with large language models (LLMs), the chatbot provides accurate, context-aware responses grounded in real discussions.

Features:-
Real-time Q&A: Ask questions related to startups, entrepreneurship, and user experiences sourced from Reddit.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Uses a vector database (FAISS) to retrieve relevant content and large language models to generate informed answers.

Context-aware conversation: Maintains chat history and reformulates queries for more natural interactions.

Data-driven insights: Powered by a curated Reddit dataset featuring posts and comments about startups and user opinions.
